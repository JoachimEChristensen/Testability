# Testability

## Static Analysis
### Find Bugs
Using Findbugs I was able to determine that my little testability project was lacking a javadoc and nothing else.

### Checkstyle
Running Checkstyle in the command line, I was able to find 8 bugs that went against its Sun_checks ruleset.

## Static Analysis pt.2
### Find Bugs
After adding the Javadoc, Findbugs returned no error.
### Checkstyle
After running Checkstyle again, the remaining bugs pertained to small lack of lines and such.
